🚀 TokenFlow — HackMol 6.0 Submission
A peer-to-peer marketplace for unused AI tokens
Unlock the value of what you already paid for. Power up those who need it.
🧠💸 Shared AI access, simplified.

🔍 Overview
❓ What Is a “Token” (in the AI Platform Context)?
A token is a unit of usage for AI platforms like OpenAI or Hugging Face.

1 token ≈ ¾ of a word (on average)

Both prompts and responses consume tokens

Every interaction with an AI model uses tokens from your account balance

💡 Example: Asking "Write a poem" might consume 5–10 tokens. The model’s response might use 100+ more.

⚙ The Problem
Many users — especially those with monthly AI subscriptions — don’t use up all their tokens. These tokens:

Expire unused

Go to waste

Can’t be transferred

Meanwhile, students, indie developers, and early-stage startups often can’t afford enough tokens to build or experiment.

💡 The Solution — TokenFlow
TokenFlow is a secure, peer-to-peer marketplace where users can list unused tokens and others can lease or buy them affordably.

Sellers monetize unused AI credits

Buyers get affordable access to tokens

All backed by secure payments and verification

🎯 Think of it as “sharing your unused AI subscription” — but automated, secure, and developer-friendly.

🛠 Setup
🔹 Step 1: Login and Connect
Users log in via a secure portal

All data is protected with end-to-end encryption (AES-256)

🔹 Step 2: List Your Tokens
Sellers add their API key from supported AI platforms

TokenFlow verifies available balance securely (without storing credentials)

Seller lists the number of tokens they want to sell

Price is automatically calculated

The token listing appears in the public marketplace

🔹 Step 3: Buyer Browses and Selects
Buyers search listings by:

AI provider (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face)

Token amount

Price range

🔹 Step 4: Secure Purchase and Dashboard Update
Payment via UPI — fast and reliable for Indian users

Upon payment:

Dashboards are updated

The listing is marked as fulfilled

Transaction records are generated

🔹 Step 5: Token Access Begins
Buyers are granted usage access via their TokenFlow dashboard

No complex routing or API handling required

🔹 Step 6: Review and Repeat
Mutual ratings for trust-building
