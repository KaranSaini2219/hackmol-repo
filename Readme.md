# 🚀 TokenFlow — HackMol 6.0 Submission

> A peer-to-peer marketplace for *unused AI tokens*  
> Unlock the value of what you already paid for. Power up those who need it.  
> 🧠💸 Shared AI access, simplified.

## ❓ What Is a “Token” (in the AI Platform Context)?

A *token* is a unit of usage for AI platforms like OpenAI or Hugging Face.

- 1 token ≈ ¾ of a word (on average)
- Both *prompts* and *responses* consume tokens
- Every interaction with an AI model uses tokens from your account balance

> 💡 Example: Asking "Write a poem" might consume 5–10 tokens. The model’s response might use 100+ more.

---

## ⚙ The Problem

Many users — especially those with monthly AI subscriptions — *don’t use up all their tokens*. These tokens:

- Expire unused
- Go to waste
- Can’t be transferred

Meanwhile, *students, indie developers, and early-stage startups* often can’t afford enough tokens to build or experiment.

---

## 💡 The Solution — TokenFlow

*TokenFlow* is a secure, peer-to-peer marketplace where users can *list unused tokens* and others can *lease or buy* them affordably.

- Sellers monetize unused AI credits
- Buyers get affordable access to tokens
- All backed by secure payments and verification

> 🎯 Think of it as “sharing your unused AI subscription” — but automated, secure, and developer-friendly.

## 🛠 How TokenFlow Works

### 🔹 Step 1: Login and Connect

- Users log in via a secure portal
- All data is protected with *end-to-end encryption (AES-256)*

---

### 🔹 Step 2: List Your Tokens

- Sellers add their *API key* from supported AI platforms
- TokenFlow *verifies available balance* securely (without storing credentials)
- Seller lists the number of tokens they want to sell
- Price is *automatically calculated* using:

- Listings are open to all — no need to select specific audiences
- The token listing appears in the public marketplace

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Buyer Browses and Selects

- Buyers search listings by:
  - AI provider (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face)
  - Token amount
  - Price range
- Once matched, they proceed to purchase

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Secure Purchase and Dashboard Update

- Payment happens via *UPI* — fast and reliable for Indian users
- Once payment is complete:
  - Dashboards for both buyer and seller are updated
  - The listing is marked as fulfilled
  - Transaction records are generated for both parties

---

### 🔹 Step 5: Token Access Begins

- Buyers are granted usage access from their *TokenFlow dashboard*
- Usage remains simple and transparent — no complex routing or API handling required

---

### 🔹 Step 6: Review and Repeat

- Buyers and sellers rate each other
- Sellers can continue to list tokens weekly/monthly
- Buyers can *subscribe to their favorite sellers*

---

## 🔐 Security First

- API key verification without storage
- End-to-end encryption (AES-256)
- Transparent UPI-based payment flow
- All user sessions and token updates are *logged securely*

---

## 📦 Use Cases

- 🎓 Students testing AI-powered projects
- 🧪 Indie devs running quick prototypes
- 💼 Startups avoiding high enterprise pricing
- 🧍 Anyone with unused AI credits who wants to recover value

---

## 🔮 Future Scope

- Subscription-based token sharing (daily/weekly access)
- Smart contract escrow (Web3 integrations)
- Analytics dashboards for sellers
- Seller reputation scores
- More AI platform integrations (Anthropic, Cohere, etc.)

---

## 🎤 Final Words

TokenFlow is more than a marketplace — it’s a smarter way to *share AI access* and avoid waste.

> No more unused credits.  
> No more barriers to building.  
> Just better access, for everyone.
